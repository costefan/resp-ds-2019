Advantages:
 - Library has good interface
 	At first, you should create matrix of shap_values for each feature in each observation.
 	Then we will use the to create plots.
 -	You can create Summary plot, which will give you an overview of which features infuenced the model most, also, you can look in which values range infuenced (high/low).
 - Also there is an ability to look at single observation (or multiple) to understand, which features influenced the result in which way (higher/lower). 
 - After looking at the big picture, there is an ability to look at the dependence plot for most influential features (for example).
 - Support of Python sklearn models, xgboost, and tensorflow/keras deep learning.
Disadvantages:
 - library is slow (in order to make it faster you should aggregate your results with k-means).
